## Introduction

Modern web services often handle complex inputs, multiple states, and numerous conditional rules. Therefore, thorough testing is essential to ensure reliability and security. This guide focuses on four major test design techniques using Python and Flask, complete with practical examples and exercises. By the end of this guide, you should be able to design effective tests for your web service projects.

## Equivalence Partitioning

### Concept and Importance

**Equivalence Partitioning** is a black-box testing technique that divides the input domain of a system into classes (or partitions) that are treated similarly by the application. If one test case in a partition passes, the others are likely to pass as well.

- **Why It’s Important:**
  - **Efficiency:** Reduces the total number of test cases by focusing on representative inputs.
  - **Coverage:** Ensures that both valid and invalid input scenarios are considered.
  - **Clarity:** Helps testers understand the behavior of the system by grouping similar inputs.

### Dividing Input Data: Valid and Invalid Groups

When testing a Flask REST API, consider an endpoint that processes user data. For example, imagine an API endpoint that registers a user:

- **Valid Groups:** 
  - A payload with all required fields properly filled.
  - Different valid types for optional fields (e.g., a valid email format, a username of acceptable length).

- **Invalid Groups:**
  - Payloads with missing required fields.
  - Payloads with invalid email formats.
  - Payloads with out-of-bound values (e.g., username too short or too long).


## Sample API Specification Document for /register

### Endpoint:
**POST** `/register`

### Description:
Registers a new user in the system.

### Request Payload:

- `username` (string, required):
  - Must be between 3 and 20 characters.

- `email` (string, required):
  - Must be in a valid email format (i.e., it should contain an "@" symbol and a ".").

### Validation Requirements:

- **Required Fields:**
  - Both username and email must be provided.

- **Username Constraints:**
  - The length must be at least 3 characters and no more than 20 characters.
  - If the username is too short (less than 3 characters) or too long (more than 20 characters), the system should return an error message such as:
    - `"Username length must be between 3 and 20 characters"`.

- **Email Format Constraints:**
  - The email must include both an "@" and a ".".
  - If the email does not meet these requirements, the system should return an error message such as:
    - `"Invalid email format"`.

### Response Codes:

- **201 Created:**
  - When the user is successfully registered.

- **400 Bad Request:**
  - When validation fails (e.g., missing required fields, invalid username length, or invalid email format).

### Example Success Request:
```json
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

### Example Error Responses:

- **Missing Username:**
```json
{
  "error": "Missing required fields"
}
```

- **Invalid Username (Too Short):**
```json
{
  "error": "Username length must be between 3 and 20 characters"
}
```

- **Invalid Email Format:**
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid email format"
}
```


**Example:**

Consider the following Flask endpoint:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register():
    data = request.get_json()
    username = data.get('username')
    email = data.get('email')
    
    if not username or not email:
        return jsonify({"error": "Missing required fields"}), 400
    
    if len(username) < 3 or len(username) > 20:
        return jsonify({"error": "Username length must be between 3 and 20 characters"}), 400
    
    if "@" not in email or "." not in email:
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid email format"}), 400

    # Registration logic here...
    return jsonify({"message": "User registered successfully"}), 201

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Equivalence Classes for `/register`:**


### Valid Equivalence Class

#### Valid Input
**E1:** A payload where the username is within the valid range (3–20 characters) and the email is in a valid format.  
**Example:**
```json
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

### Invalid Equivalence Classes

#### Missing Required Fields
**E2:** Payload with one or more missing required fields.  
**Example 1 (missing username):**
```json
{
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```
**Example 2 (missing email):**
```json
{
  "username": "john_doe"
}
```

#### Invalid Username Length
**E3:** Payload where the username is outside the allowed length range (either too short or too long).  
**Example (too short):**
```json
{
  "username": "jo",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```
**Example (too long):**
```json
{
  "username": "j" * 25,
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

#### Invalid Email Format
**E4:** Payload where the email does not meet the format requirements (e.g., missing "@" or ".").  
**Example:**
```json
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "johnexample.com"
}
```

### Case Study: Testing API Payloads

**Scenario:** Testing the `/register` endpoint for equivalence classes.

1. **Identify Inputs:** `username` and `email`.
2. **Determine Partitions:**
   - **Username Valid:** Between 3 and 20 characters.
   - **Username Invalid:** Less than 3 or more than 20 characters.
   - **Email Valid:** Contains "@" and a domain.
   - **Email Invalid:** Does not meet the above condition.
3. **Test Cases:** Create test cases for each partition.

### Exercises for Equivalence Partitioning

1. **Exercise 1:**  
   For an API endpoint `/login` that requires a `username` and `password`, define the valid and invalid equivalence classes if:
   - The username must be 5–15 characters long.
   - The password must be at least 8 characters long.
   
2. **Exercise 2:**  
   Create additional test cases for the `/register` endpoint by considering optional fields (e.g., `phone_number`) with a valid pattern.

3. **Exercise 3:**  
   Write a Python script using the Flask test client to automate testing of the `/register` endpoint with payloads representing each equivalence class.

## Boundary Value Analysis


# Boundary Value Analysis for the /register Endpoint

## Overview

**Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** focuses on testing the edges of input ranges where errors are most likely to occur. In our **/register** API, the two primary fields are:

- **username**: Must be between **3 and 20 characters**.
- **email**: Must be in a valid email format (i.e., include both an "@" and a ".").

Testing the boundaries helps ensure the system correctly handles the minimum, maximum, and just-outside-the-boundary cases, thus increasing overall confidence in the application.

---

## Why Boundary Value Analysis is Critical

- **Edge Case Identification:**  
  Many bugs surface at the limits of acceptable input. Testing the boundary values (e.g., usernames with 2, 3, 20, and 21 characters) helps uncover issues that might not be caught when testing only typical values.
  
- **Increased Confidence:**  
  Verifying edge cases ensures the system gracefully handles input that is exactly on or just outside the boundaries.
  
- **Complement to Equivalence Partitioning:**  
  While equivalence partitioning tests representative values from valid and invalid classes, BVA zeroes in on the precise thresholds where errors are most common.

---

## Use Case: /register API Endpoint Specification

### Endpoint Details

- **Endpoint:** `POST /register`
- **Description:** Registers a new user in the system.

### Request Payload

- **username (string, required):**  
  - Must be between 3 and 20 characters.
  - If not, returns an error: `"Username length must be between 3 and 20 characters"`.

- **email (string, required):**  
  - Must contain both an "@" symbol and a ".".
  - If not, returns an error: `"Invalid email format"`.

### Response Codes

- **201 Created:**  
  Successful user registration.

- **400 Bad Request:**  
  Validation failures (e.g., missing required fields, invalid username length, or invalid email format).

#### Example Requests

- **Success:**

  ```json
  {
    "username": "john_doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
  ```

- **Error – Missing Field:**

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Missing required fields"
  }
  ```

- **Error – Invalid Username:**

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Username length must be between 3 and 20 characters"
  }
  ```

- **Error – Invalid Email Format:**

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Invalid email format"
  }
  ```

---

## Boundary Value Analysis for the /register Endpoint

### Username Boundary Cases

Given the username must be between **3 and 20 characters**, the key boundary values include:

- **Minimum Valid:**  
  - Exactly 3 characters (e.g., `"abc"`).
- **Just Below Minimum:**  
  - 2 characters (e.g., `"ab"`).
- **Maximum Valid:**  
  - Exactly 20 characters (e.g., `"a" * 20`).
- **Just Above Maximum:**  
  - 21 characters (e.g., `"a" * 21`).

### Email Format Considerations

While email validation focuses on format rather than length, the following boundary-like cases are important:

- **Valid Email:**  
  - Contains both "@" and "." (e.g., `"john@example.com"`).
- **Invalid Email – Missing "@":**  
  - (e.g., `"johnexample.com"`).
- **Invalid Email – Missing ".":**  
  - (e.g., `"john@examplecom"`).

---

## Sample Flask Implementation

Below is an example of a Flask endpoint implementing the above validation logic:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register():
    data = request.get_json()
    username = data.get('username')
    email = data.get('email')
    
    # Check for required fields
    if not username or not email:
        return jsonify({"error": "Missing required fields"}), 400
    
    # Validate username length
    if len(username) < 3 or len(username) > 20:
        return jsonify({"error": "Username length must be between 3 and 20 characters"}), 400
    
    # Validate email format
    if "@" not in email or "." not in email:
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid email format"}), 400

    # Registration logic here...
    return jsonify({"message": "User registered successfully"}), 201

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

```

---

## Equivalence Classes for /register

### Valid Equivalence Class

- **E1: Valid Input**  
  A payload with a username of 3–20 characters and an email with both "@" and ".".  
  **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "username": "john_doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
  ```

### Invalid Equivalence Classes

- **E2: Missing Required Fields**  
  Payload missing either the username or email.  
  **Examples:**
  ```json
  {
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
  ```
  ```json
  {
    "username": "john_doe"
  }
  ```

- **E3: Invalid Username Length**  
  Username is too short or too long.  
  **Examples:**
  - Too Short:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "ab",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
    ```
  - Too Long:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "j" * 25,  // 25 characters
      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
    ```

- **E4: Invalid Email Format**  
  Email does not contain the required characters.  
  **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "username": "john_doe",
    "email": "johnexample.com"
  }
  ```

## Sample Python Test Code Using Flask's Test Client

Here is an example of how you might write unit tests for the boundary values using Flask's test client:

```python
import unittest
import json
from your_flask_app import app  # Ensure your app is imported properly

class TestRegisterBoundaryValues(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.client = app.test_client()

    # Username Boundary Tests
    def test_username_min_valid(self):
        payload = {"username": "abc", "email": "john@example.com"}
        response = self.client.post('/register', json=payload)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 201)

    def test_username_below_min(self):
        payload = {"username": "ab", "email": "john@example.com"}
        response = self.client.post('/register', json=payload)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 400)

    def test_username_max_valid(self):
        payload = {"username": "a" * 20, "email": "john@example.com"}
        response = self.client.post('/register', json=payload)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 201)

    def test_username_above_max(self):
        payload = {"username": "a" * 21, "email": "john@example.com"}
        response = self.client.post('/register', json=payload)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 400)

    # Email Format Tests
    def test_valid_email_format(self):
        payload = {"username": "john_doe", "email": "john@example.com"}
        response = self.client.post('/register', json=payload)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 201)

    def test_invalid_email_missing_at(self):
        payload = {"username": "john_doe", "email": "johnexample.com"}
        response = self.client.post('/register', json=payload)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 400)

    def test_invalid_email_missing_dot(self):
        payload = {"username": "john_doe", "email": "john@examplecom"}
        response = self.client.post('/register', json=payload)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 400)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

## Exercises for Boundary Value Analysis

**Exercise 1:**  
For the **/register** endpoint, identify the boundary values for the `username` parameter (which must be 3–20 characters). List the corresponding test cases (including just-below and just-above values).

**Exercise 2:**  
Extend the **/register** endpoint to include a `phone_number` field that must be exactly 10 digits long. Identify the boundary values (i.e., test with 9 digits, 10 digits, and 11 digits) and implement corresponding test cases.

**Exercise 3:**  
Create a diagram for the boundary values of the `password` field (assuming a requirement of a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 20 characters). Include markers for just-below, valid, and just-above cases.

# State Transition Testing

State transition testing is a method that involves testing the transitions between different states of a system. This technique is especially useful in systems that implement workflows, user session management, or any scenario where the system’s behavior changes based on its current state.

## Concept and Role in Verifying Systems

- **Dynamic Behavior:**  
  Many systems (e.g., authentication systems, shopping carts) have multiple states that impact functionality. For example, a user authentication system might have states such as _Logged Out_, _Logged In_, and _Locked_.

- **Comprehensive Coverage:**  
  By testing state transitions, you ensure that the system handles shifts from one state to another correctly—catching errors that might only appear when moving between states.

- **User Flows:**  
  This technique validates the overall user experience. For example, it confirms that after a successful login the user is indeed in a _Logged In_ state, and that logging out correctly reverts the state to _Logged Out_.

## Designing Tests Based on States and Transitions

In a black-box testing approach, you do not have access to the internal code. Instead, you rely on the documented specifications, observable outputs (e.g., API responses, HTTP status codes, session cookies), and any state diagrams provided by the requirements. Here’s how you can approach it:

1. **Review Specifications and Diagrams:**  
   - The design documents or requirements may include a state transition diagram that outlines the various states and the actions (or events) that trigger transitions.  
   - **Placeholder:** *Insert or reference state transition diagram here*

2. **Identify Observable Behaviors:**  
   - **API Responses:** HTTP status codes, response messages, and headers are visible outputs that indicate whether a state transition has occurred.
   - **Session Management:** For web applications, the presence or absence of session tokens or cookies (visible via browser tools or automated tests) indicates the user’s state.
   - **User Interface (UI) Elements:** Changes in the UI (such as the appearance of a “Logout” button upon successful login) also reflect state transitions.

3. **Define Test Cases Based on Expected Behavior:**  
   - Identify the initial states, the actions that cause transitions, and the expected outcomes after those transitions.
   - Even without internal code access, your tests are based on what the specifications say should happen.

## Example Scenario: User Authentication System

Consider a system with the following states:

- **Logged Out**
- **Logged In**
- **Locked** (after several failed login attempts)

**Transitions:**

- **From Logged Out to Logged In:**
  - **Action:** Successful login with valid credentials.
  - **Observable Outcome:** The system returns a “Login successful” message, a 200 status code, and creates a session token.

- **From Logged Out to Locked:**
  - **Action:** Multiple failed login attempts.
  - **Observable Outcome:** The system returns an error message like “Account locked due to too many failed attempts” with a 403 status code.

- **From Logged In to Logged Out:**
  - **Action:** User logs out.
  - **Observable Outcome:** The system returns a “Logged out successfully” message, a 200 status code, and clears the session token.

- **From Locked to Logged Out:**
  - **Action:** An admin unlocks the account or a timeout expires.
  - **Observable Outcome:** The system reverts to the _Logged Out_ state (or a dedicated _Unlocked_ state) with appropriate messaging.

**Placeholder:** *Insert state transition diagram here, if available*

## Testing State Transitions in a Black-Box Manner

Even without internal access to the code, you can test state transitions by:

- **Relying on Documentation:** Use the state diagrams and specifications provided.
- **Observing External Artifacts:** Validate transitions by checking:
  - HTTP response codes and messages.
  - Session tokens or cookies using browser tools or automated tests.
  - UI changes if testing through a graphical interface.
- **Designing Test Cases:** Write tests that simulate user actions (e.g., login, failed login attempts, logout) and verify that the system’s responses match the expected outcomes for each state transition.

## Flask Example: User Authentication with State Transitions

Below is a simplified Flask implementation demonstrating state transitions in a user authentication system:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, session
from datetime import timedelta

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'secret_key'
app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'] = timedelta(minutes=30)

# Simulated user database
USERS = {
    "user1": {"password": "password123", "failed_attempts": 0, "locked": False}
}

MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS = 3

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    data = request.get_json()
    username = data.get('username')
    password = data.get('password')

    user = USERS.get(username)
    if not user:
        return jsonify({"error": "User not found"}), 404

    if user['locked']:
        return jsonify({"error": "Account is locked"}), 403

    if password == user['password']:
        user['failed_attempts'] = 0
        session['username'] = username
        return jsonify({"message": "Login successful"}), 200
    else:
        user['failed_attempts'] += 1
        if user['failed_attempts'] >= MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS:
            user['locked'] = True
            return jsonify({"error": "Account locked due to too many failed attempts"}), 403
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid credentials"}), 401

@app.route('/logout', methods=['POST'])
def logout():
    if 'username' in session:
        session.pop('username')
        return jsonify({"message": "Logged out successfully"}), 200
    return jsonify({"error": "No active session"}), 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Exercises for State Transition Testing

1. **Exercise 1:**  
   Draw a detailed state transition diagram for an online shopping cart system.  
   - *Hint:* Consider states such as _Empty_, _Active_, _Checked Out_, and _Abandoned_.

2. **Exercise 2:**  
   Extend the Flask authentication example to include a “password reset” state.  
   - *Task:* Define transitions from _Locked_ to _Password Reset_ and back to _Logged Out_ after a successful reset.

3. **Exercise 3:**  
   Write unit tests using Flask’s test client for the authentication system to simulate the state transitions.  
   - *Tip:* Use the observable outputs (HTTP responses, session tokens) to confirm that the system has transitioned to the expected state.
```

## Decision Table Testing

### Definition and Usefulness

**Decision Table Testing** is a technique used to systematically represent and test combinations of conditions and actions. It is particularly useful when the system has multiple rules and conditions that determine its behavior.

- **Why It’s Useful:**
  - **Clarity:** Helps visualize complex business logic.
  - **Coverage:** Ensures that all possible combinations of inputs (conditions) and corresponding actions are considered.
  - **Maintenance:** Simplifies updates when business rules change.

### Creating Decision Tables for Web Service Scenarios

**Scenario:** Consider an API endpoint `/resource` that enforces access control. The decision to allow access depends on the following conditions:
- **User Role:** `admin`, `user`, `guest`
- **Resource Type:** `public`, `private`
- **Time of Day:** Within working hours (9 AM – 5 PM) or outside

**Decision Table:**

| Condition / Rule            | Rule 1         | Rule 2         | Rule 3         | Rule 4         |
|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **User Role**               | admin          | user           | guest          | user           |
| **Resource Type**           | private        | private        | public         | private        |
| **Within Working Hours?**   | Yes            | Yes            | Yes            | No             |
| **Expected Action**         | Allow access   | Allow access   | Allow access   | Deny access    |

From this decision table, you can derive test cases that cover each rule.

### Step-by-Step Examples

1. **Step 1:** Identify conditions and possible values.
2. **Step 2:** Create the decision table as shown above.
3. **Step 3:** Map each rule to test cases.

**Flask Example:**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

def is_within_working_hours():
    now = datetime.now().time()
    start = datetime.strptime("09:00", "%H:%M").time()
    end = datetime.strptime("17:00", "%H:%M").time()
    return start <= now <= end

@app.route('/resource', methods=['GET'])
def access_resource():
    user_role = request.args.get('role')
    resource_type = request.args.get('type')
    
    # Conditions based on decision table
    if user_role == "admin" and resource_type == "private":
        return jsonify({"access": "allowed"}), 200
    if user_role == "user" and resource_type == "private" and is_within_working_hours():
        return jsonify({"access": "allowed"}), 200
    if user_role == "guest" and resource_type == "public":
        return jsonify({"access": "allowed"}), 200
    # Additional conditions
    return jsonify({"access": "denied"}), 403

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Exercises for Decision Table Testing

1. **Exercise 1:**  
   Create a decision table for a payment processing API that considers:
   - Payment method (`credit`, `debit`, `paypal`)
   - Transaction amount (below \$1000, \$1000 and above)
   - User status (`verified`, `unverified`)
   
   Then, derive test cases from your table.

2. **Exercise 2:**  
   Modify the `/resource` endpoint example to include an additional condition (e.g., IP address restrictions). Update your decision table and implement the changes.

3. **Exercise 3:**  
   Write unit tests that iterate through all decision table rules for the `/resource` endpoint to ensure that each combination of conditions is properly handled.
